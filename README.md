# Environment Perception For Self-Driving Cars
As the final project for Visual Perception in Self-driving Cars course by Coursera, this notebook represents materials to extract useful scene information to allow self-driving cars to safely and reliably traverse their environment.

**This notebook presents:**
- Using the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement drivable space estimation in 3D.
- Using the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement lane estimation.
- Using the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the output of 2D object detectors. 
- Using the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car.
